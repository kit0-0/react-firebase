### CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):

**1. Introduction:**
   -  "Imagine someone tricking a website into thinking you did something you didn't actually do."

**2. Example:**
   -  "Imagine you're signing a contract and someone slips in an extra page without you noticing. That's like what CSRF does to websites."
   -  "Let's say you're logged into a shopping website and click a link that secretly buys something without you knowing."

**3. How it Works:**
   -  "The attacker tricks you into clicking a link that sends a request to the website as if you did it yourself."
   -  "It's like someone pretending to be you and doing things on your behalf without permission."

**4. Prevention:**
   -  "To stop this, websites use special codes called tokens that only you and the website know."
   -  "It's like having a secret handshake. If you don't know it, the website won't trust you."

### JWT (JSON Web Tokens):

**1. Introduction:**
   -  "JWT is like a secret message that only you and the website can understand."

**2. Example:**
   -  "Imagine you're getting a stamp on your hand at a party to show you're allowed to enter. JWT is like that stamp, but for websites."
   -  "When you log in, the website gives you a stamp (JWT) that you show whenever you want to do something important."

**3. Key Concepts:**
   - "JWT has three parts: a header, a body, and a signature."
   -  "It's like a secret recipe. The header says what kind of recipe it is, the body lists the ingredients, and the signature ensures it's authentic."

**4. Use Cases:**
   - "Websites use JWT to remember who you are without asking for your username and password every time."
   - "When you log in to your email, the website gives you a JWT so you can read and send emails without logging in again."

**5. Best Practices:**
   - Teach about security: "Just like you wouldn't show your stamp to strangers, websites shouldn't share your JWT with anyone else."
   - Emphasize safety measures: "It's important to keep your stamp (JWT) safe and not let others see it, or they could pretend to be you."
